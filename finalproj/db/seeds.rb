# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)


# Seed one admin and two regular users

u1.username = 'regular1'

u1.password_confirmation = 'password'
u1.save!

u2.email = 'regular2@email.com'
u2.username = 'regular2'
u2.password = 'password'

u3.password = 'password'
u3.password_confirmation = 'password'
u3.isadmin = true
u3.reputation = 10
